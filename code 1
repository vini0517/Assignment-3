/*So this is how we get string of input from user and also get another string input from user as pattern and determine number of time
such pattern occurred and also display the position of the pattern in the given string 1.And the program is executed successfully.
working of this program:
1) declare header files stdio.h and string.h(because we are using string)
2) declclaring string and substring length
3) getting string and substring from user
4) using loop to find the count and repeated string
